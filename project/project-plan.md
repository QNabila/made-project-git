# Project Plan

## Title
Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination on Infection Rates in the Americas

## Main Question

1. How did COVID-19 vaccination rates influence infection rates in different countries across the Americas in 2021?

## Description

This project investigates the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates and infection rates across North, Central, and South America. The objective is to determine if higher vaccination rates are associated with lower infection rates. By analyzing data from the Americas, the project will produce results that can highlight the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in controlling COVID-19 transmission.

Specifically, the project will:

Compare vaccination rates with infection rates in various countries
Quantify the relationship between vaccination coverage and infection reduction
Draw a conclusion on the impact of vaccination on public health
This analysis can provide evidence to public health officials regarding the benefits of vaccination campaigns, which may guide future pandemic response strategies.
